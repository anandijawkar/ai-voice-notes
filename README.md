🗣️ AI Meeting Confidence Coach
🌍 Problem
In team meetings, many employees — especially juniors or underrepresented voices — hesitate to share their ideas due to lack of confidence, unclear communication, or fear of being misunderstood. This leads to:
Fewer diverse perspectives.
Lower team engagement.
Missed opportunities for innovation.
💡 Solution
An AI-powered assistant that joins meetings (live or recorded) and provides personalized feedback on communication style, confidence, and clarity.
Helps individuals improve presentation and self-expression skills.
Gives managers/team leads aggregated insights on participation balance (e.g., who spoke most/least, overall tone).
Supports long-term growth with personal goals and progress tracking.



⚙️ Core Features (MVP – achievable in 36 hrs)
User Accounts & Profiles


Simple login with username, company, role.
Optional: set personal communication goals (e.g., “Speak more concisely,” “Use confident tone”).
Backend with lightweight database (Firebase, Supabase, or MongoDB).


Meeting Analysis (Individual Mode)


Detect speech via voice recognition (speech-to-text).
Analyze tone of voice + word choice (using Gemini / existing NLP APIs).
Provide structured feedback post-meeting (e.g., “Your tone was confident 70% of the time. Avoid filler words like ‘um’.”).


Meeting Analysis (Team Mode)


Manager runs the tool → records group meeting.
AI generates team summary: who contributed, sentiment distribution, dominant speakers, etc.
Highlights opportunities: “Encourage quieter members to share,” or “Discussion leaned negative toward X topic.”
